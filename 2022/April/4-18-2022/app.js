// Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".
// If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo

// The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings:
// name + " plays banjo" 
// name + " does not play banjo"

// P: enter a name both upper and lower case. 

function areYouPlayingBanjo(name) {
    // Implement me
    return name;
